    "text": "Quarto (abbreviated Qto, 4to or 4º) is the format of a book or pamphlet produced from full sheets printed with eight pages of text, four to a side, then folded twice to produce four leaves. The leaves are then trimmed along the folds to produce eight book pages. Each printed page presents as one-fourth size of the full sheet.1\n1 If this is working that is really nice.The earliest known European printed book is a quarto, the Sibyllenbuch, believed to have been printed by Johannes Gutenberg in 1452–53, before the Gutenberg Bible, surviving only as a fragment. Quarto is also used as a general description of size of books that are about 12 inches (30 cm) tall, and as such does not necessarily indicate the actual printing format of the books, which may even be unknown, as is the case for many modern books. These terms are discussed in greater detail in book sizes.\n\n# this is a sample code block to reverse a list \n1def reverse_list(list):\n    return list[:-1]\n\n\n1\n\nwill this code annotation work ? hardly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro Tip: This dataset was cleaned using the Pandas library before ingestion."
