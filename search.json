A transfer learning method for NLP that performs state-of-the-art text classification.\n\n\nMixed Precision\nPerformance\nNative support for fp16 training (to_fp16()), which speeds up training on modern GPUs and reduces memory usage.\n\n\nTTA (Test Time Augmentation)\nInference\nAutomatically creates multiple augmented versions of test images and averages their predictions for higher accuracy (learn.tta()).\n\n\nTransforms Pipeline\nAugmentation\nA dual-pipeline system (item transforms vs. batch transforms) that runs augmentations on the GPU for speed.\n\n\nCallbacks System\nCustomization\nA rich event system allowing you to inject code at any point in the training loop (e.g., SaveModelCallback, EarlyStoppingCallback)."
